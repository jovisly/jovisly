### Hello! This is Jen 👋

I’m a Computational Researcher turned Data Scientist turned Full Stack Engineer.
I love building useful, algorithm-driven softwares from the ground up.

I got my PhD in Physics (large-scale simulations of biological systems). Then I
worked at [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/) and [Google](https://www.google.com/).
Subsequently I joined a startup as its very first hire.

- 🌱 Currently, I'm participating in the W1'23 batch of [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and loving it!
- 🛠️ I'm also the n=1 team behind [HeroMode](https://heromodeapp.com/), a gamified task manager that helps you get more done with intrinsic motivation!
- 💻 My obsession at the moment is Deep Reinforcement Learning
- 💬 Let's talk about: python, cross-platform development with React Native, ML/AI, algorithms, and zero-to-one product development
